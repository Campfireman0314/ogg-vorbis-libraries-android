# libogg and libvorbis libraries for Android

## Presentation

* For simplicity sake, this code is licensed under the same license as the libvorbis library from http://xiph.org/vorbis/
* This project is highly inspired from https://github.com/MoNTE48/libvorbis-android

This project provides static libogg and libvorbis libraries, and also allows you to compile them on your own, using build.sh.

## Usage

To compile the libraries and generate the headers, here is how you can proceed (tested on Linux Ubuntu 16.04.5):

1. Download the Android NDK here: https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/, and choose Linux 64-bit (x86) (tested with version r18b)
2. Unzip the Android NDK in your *home* directory, and name it android-ndk
3. Clone this project, also in your *home* directory, and go in it (in ogg-vorbis-libraries-android)
4. In the *ogg-vorbis-libraries-android* directory, open a terminal
5. Add the ndk-build in your PATH, by typing: `PATH=${PATH}:/home/<your_user_name>/android-ndk/build`
6. Then, `chmod +x ./build.sh`
7. Finally, compile everything by typing: `./build.sh`

## Implementation in an Android project

To implement the libraries and the headers in an Android project, here is how you can proceed (tested on Android Studio 3.2.1):

1. Create a new Android project with "Include C++ support"
2. In your *cpp* folder, create a new package *vorbis*
3. From this project, copy the *lib* directory and paste it in the *vorbis* directory in your project
4. In each subdirectory (*arm64-v8a*, *armeabi-v7a*, *x86* and *x86_64*), create an *include* directory and, from this project, copy the *ogg* and *vorbis* that are in the *inc* directory, and paste them in the *include* directory you just created
5. In your *app/build.gradle* file, add the following in the *android > defaultConfig > externalNativeBuild > cmake* bloc:
   ```
   abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'
   ```
6. In your *CMakeLists.txt* file, add the following:
   ```
   set(vorbis_DIR ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src/main/cpp/vorbis)
   add_library(ogg STATIC IMPORTED)
   set_target_properties(ogg PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION
           ${vorbis_DIR}/lib/${ANDROID_ABI}/libogg.a)
   
   add_library(vorbis STATIC IMPORTED)
   set_target_properties(vorbis PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION
           ${vorbis_DIR}/lib/${ANDROID_ABI}/libvorbis.a)
   
   include_directories(${vorbis_DIR}/lib/${ANDROID_ABI}/include)
   ```
   and in the *target_link_libraries* bloc, add these two lines:
   ```
   ${vorbis_DIR}/lib/${ANDROID_ABI}/libogg.a
   ${vorbis_DIR}/lib/${ANDROID_ABI}/libvorbis.a
   ```

At this point, it should compile and run.
